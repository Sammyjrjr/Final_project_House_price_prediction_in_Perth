  # Conclusion:
The features that have the most impact on the price are:
Floor area: It's the most important feature to decide the price.(e.g if you want a huge building space the price will be higher.)
Post code: the price increase depending on which Post code do you want to live(e.g near the coast or the CBD are expensive)
City center: the nearer to the center, the more expensive.
Latitude and Longitude: The orientation of the house also impacts in the price. (e.g the houses oriented to the east are expensive)
